This repository contains Berkeley DB XML 2.5.16, plus some small patches for
bugs that we have encountered.

The reason for maintaining this repository is twofold:

- Berkeley DB XML 6.1 contains a bug that returns an incorrect number of
  nodes for some queries.

- Berkeley DB XML 6.1 switched from the Sleepy Cat License to the Affero
  GPL version 3. This probably conflicts with some of the many indirect
  dependencies of e.g. Dact.
